To calculate the number of Voltorbs required to fully power the Jubilife village:
1. **Determine the amount of electricity that each Voltorb can produce**: For this, we must consider the fact that Voltorbs need some rest and recovery time. Therefore, we can, for example, create 2 equal batches of Voltorb, so each batch works alternately for half a day while the other batch rests.

  2. **Calculate the amount of energy the whole Jubilife village would need each day**: In order to achieve this, we divide all of the buildings present in this village into two categories: **Household** and **Distinctive** _(such as TV station, Poketch Company, Trainer's School, Global Trade Station, and Jubilife Condominiums)_.

To get the total Household population, we can average out the `87` and `124` figures shown in _Pokemon Diamond and Pearl_ as well as _Pokemon Platinum_ respectively. 
`(124 + 87) / 2 = 106 people`
Assuming a person's daily electricity consumption is [12.1kWh](https://css.umich.edu/factsheets/us-energy-system-factsheet). So, `106 * 12.1 = 1283kWh` is the total energy we require per day for the Households.

For the Distinct buildings category, if we assume `1000kWh/per building`, then `1000*5 = 5000kWh/day` would be the total energy we require for all the distinctive buildings in total.<br/> 
So, the total power required by Jubily life village each day would be **`1283 + 5000 = 6283 kWh`**

**From aforementioned points**, say each Voltorb could product `10kWh` energy each day, we would required **`6283/10 ~ 630 Voltorbs`**. Thus, we can create two batches of `315 Voltorbs` each which can work alternatively to supply power to whole Jubilife Village.
