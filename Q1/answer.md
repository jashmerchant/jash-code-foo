My name is **Jash Merchant** and I am currently pursuing my **Masters in Computer Science** from **New York University**.<br/>

I am wanting to apply to **IGN's Code Foo Engineering Internship** position as I believe that I can effectively leverage the learnings from my participation in a mentorship experience where I was appointed as a CS50 Mentor during which I had to assist in solving conceptual queries of students related to Harvard Universityâ€™s CS50W course and help them troubleshoot technical issues. Additionally, my adeptness at _Full Stack development, Python, React, Django, SQL as well as NoSQL_, that is the result of undertakings such as online boot camps, hands-on projects, and certifications (_OCJP SE6_) will come in handy as well.<br/>

My leadership skills, which I have honed by leading my project team for six consecutive semesters will enable me to stand out from other applicants.<br/> 

I am also someone who can collaborate well with a team on account of my excellent interpersonal skills and can take on the responsibility without buckling under pressure. I am convinced that at IGN I will get to interact with individuals from diverse academic and cultural backgrounds and this will both widen my perspective and augment my knowledge.<br/> 

Thus, I strongly believe that my internship and volunteering experiences, and effective interpersonal skills will make me a great fit for this role.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
